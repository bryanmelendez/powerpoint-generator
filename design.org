* Pseudocode

- create the presentation
- search for image files within image directory
  - create tuples with the image path
  - parse the file name to obtain page title
  - keep searching for images until one is not found
- Loop:
  - each loop corresponds with an option
  - create a page
  - add title from tuple
  - add image from file path

Issue: it creates the next option title page before it checks if there
        are any more options

Solution:
        -
